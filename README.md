# boggle
boggle game

Dependencies:
npm install npm@latest -g
chai
npm install chai --save
mocha
npm install mocha --save
express
npm install express --save

I found the test in codewars 

https://www.codewars.com/kata/boggle-word-checker/train/javascript

I then re-wrote it and ran it in the sample test with solution code. I tried to install chai and mocha to run the tests via the terminal but was unable to get them to work. 

To run boggle, open the zipped file and click on the html file this will open it in a google chrome window. I didn't set it up on a localhost to open with nodemon in the terminal as I wanted to keep refreshing the window to see if the function would work with the boggle board that I created. Unfortunatly I wasn't able to get the board to work. I did test that the html was connected to the app.js with a console.log, but could not figure out how to re-write the function to work with the boggle board. I wrote the code in Sublime Text.
